## CoP Design Patterns and Algorithms

Welcome to our Backend CoP repository ðŸ‘‹. 

This repo is dedicated to the implementation of algorithms and design patterns from our CoP Sessions. Each session we spend a small portion of time on the theory of one design pattern or algorithm and then we try to implement it in the technology of choice. 

## Contribution
We welcome contributions in any programming language. We especially welcome contributions in languages that don't follow a standard strongly-typed OOP paradigm and thus solve the same problem in a different way.

Here are a couple of simple rules. 

* Follow folder structure `/[number + pattern/alg]/[language]/[code]`
* Contribute through PR
* Write code as simple and clean as possible
* Dont commit any additional build artifacts
